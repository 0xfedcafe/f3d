title: Thumbnailer

F3D can be used as a thumbnailer in certain cases

## Linux

During instalation, F3D will install mime types files as defined by the [XDG standard](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html) and a thumbnailer file as specified [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_manager_functionality#Thumbnail_previews). Many file managers use this mechanism, including nautilus, thunar, pcmanfm and caja. Make sure to update the mime types database using [update-mime-database](https://linux.die.net/man/1/update-mime-database).
